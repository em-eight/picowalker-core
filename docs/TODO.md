## Bug Fixes

- Do not draw inside interrupts, instead have some sort of request flags to request redraw
  before/after an event loop iteration.
- Similar thing for changing states, request a state change, then fulfil it after event loop
  ends.


## Features

- Pokewalker data
- Minigames
- Proper IR functionality
- Accelerometer
